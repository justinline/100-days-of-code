# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a full page color-picker with vanilla javascript!

**Thoughts:** I tried as best as possible to do this from muscle memory as a warm up - considering JS is one of the weaker of my languages. Mozilla MDN proved useful in a pinch. Going to try and make a lot of single page js apps in this way as practice to build a strong familiarity of the fundamentals.

**Afterthoughts:** Tested it in Firefox and i'd overlooked the mousewheel event listener being slightly different. Need to learn to catch these early on.

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Began coding with 'Processing' (for Python)

**Thoughts:** Really fun and easy to pick up. Would like to start making generative art with it further down the line.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deployed my django-based portfolio site!

**Thoughts:** Quite a lengthy process, would like to see how I can streamline. Need to work out how to pull any updates without intefering with migrations, data and such.

### Day 3: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a 'Is it 2018 yet?' countdown

**Thoughts:** Quick one due to a busy day, didn't have time to think about anything else!
