# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a full page color-picker with vanilla javascript!

**Thoughts:** I tried as best as possible to do this from muscle memory as a warm up - considering JS is one of the weaker of my languages. Mozilla MDN proved useful in a pinch. Going to try and make a lot of single page js apps in this way as practice to build a strong familiarity of the fundamentals.

**Afterthoughts:** Tested it in Firefox and i'd overlooked the mousewheel event listener being slightly different. Need to learn to catch these early on.
