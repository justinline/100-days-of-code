# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a full page color-picker with vanilla javascript!

**Thoughts:** I tried as best as possible to do this from muscle memory as a warm up - considering JS is one of the weaker of my languages. Mozilla MDN proved useful in a pinch. Going to try and make a lot of single page js apps in this way as practice to build a strong familiarity of the fundamentals.

**Afterthoughts:** Tested it in Firefox and i'd overlooked the mousewheel event listener being slightly different. Need to learn to catch these early on.

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Began coding with 'Processing' (for Python)

**Thoughts:** Really fun and easy to pick up. Would like to start making generative art with it further down the line.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deployed my django-based portfolio site!

**Thoughts:** Quite a lengthy process, would like to see how I can streamline. Need to work out how to pull any updates without intefering with migrations, data and such.

### Day 3: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a 'Is it 2018 yet?' countdown

**Thoughts:** Quick one due to a busy day, didn't have time to think about anything else!

### Day 4: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the Visualisation projects on FCC

**Thoughts:** Only had enough time to get in some warming up for today. Going to be looking to complete these in the week!

### Day 5: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got started with D3.js on my lunch break

**Thoughts:** It's taking time to get to grips with the library, especially with the differences between v3 and v4 of D3 - lots of advice and examples are written in V3 but i'm going for V4 usage. Got the data loaded and the bars/axes showing, but i'm having trouble figuring out how to style the axes the way I want.

### Day 6/7: January 3/4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished constructing the D3 Bar chart

**Thoughts:** Took time to differentiate through the differences between V3 and V4 of D3.js - some of the functions are pretty different in name. Need to add title and some better styling still but this is progress enough for the time being!

### Day 8: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Coachella Roulette

**Thoughts:** Needed some new inspiration for music to listen to at work. Decided to make a script to select a random performer from the Coachella 2018 lineup. Very fun, quick and extremely satisfying. May add some more functionality in future.

### Day 9 and 10: January 6/7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CSS Drawings

**Thoughts:** Had serious migraines over the weekend and couldn't bear to look at a screen. The times I did I spend working through 'https://coding-artist.teachable.com/courses/155435' to draw CSS images.

### Day 11: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Dove into Rhinoscript for the first time, using python, and made a handy tool for creating cutting lists in my Rhino drawings!

**Thoughts:** Documentation is quite confusing - and there are multiple ways to do certain things. Got there eventually! Using dir() helps a lot to see what methods are bound to an object or class
